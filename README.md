Front End Assessment for Elite Digital by Sonam Klein

Created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Deployed with Express to Heroku: https://polar-mesa-73443.herokuapp.com/

I set this project up to use jquery as well, but I actually didn't end needing it.

Issues that need work:
 - .png images not loading through Heroku
 - footer not taking up bottom space, white showing through
 - need to set jumbotron text to start at half point
 - jumbotron image needs to be optimized for mobile
